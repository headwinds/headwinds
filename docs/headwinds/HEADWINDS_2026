We replaced our sales team with 20 AI agents—here’s what happened | Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)

## My take:

What if we could dial down AI to work more human-like or even superhuman hours like 80-100 hrs in week instead of 247 aka 168 hrs in week? Then, we can always keep a human in the loop. 

I'm looking for ways to create a more active AI experience where it isn't waiting for you prompt. If a human editor (or art director!) was standing over your shoulder, they would actively critique the work without being asked. 

The author may not realize what is wrong so how could they ask for guidance if they don't see the flaw. A human would review the doc and make proactive recommendations; an AI could do likewise constantly sweeping the doc within an interval or perhaps limited to a few times as we need to wary of token expenditure.
