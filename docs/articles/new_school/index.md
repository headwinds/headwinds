# Old School 

In high school, I had high hopes to enter the video game industry as a programmer but I was struggling in Calculus and ended up dropping that course ending my dream to major in computer science since I needed both Calculus and Finite and I had neither. To this day it haunts me that I failed to finish them. Creating video games should have been motivation enough but something was missing to make math more compelling. I was already fascinated with programming. I earned an A+ in my final year of high school comp sci where we programmed in Cobol! But lack lustre D- in Calculus and that's when I decide to drop it to pursue the Arts. 

I also had high marks in Biology yet a science major also required math credits so my only choice was the Arts.

I really wanted to go to University. I had enough motivation to make it to University that I believe that I could have earned my math credits if I wasn't able to simple side step that barrier and drop them. What if math was required to get into the Arts?! Some math is certainly practical in the Arts especially Trig. 
Why was able to excel in Biology but not Calculus? Was it the teacher? the course material? 


In 1999, I graduated from the University of Waterloo with an honours English degree and a Creative Writing award. I was actually able to take a few compi sci electives that focussed on programming. This was before Java and then Python took over University. I remember writing an eCommerce program in Turbo Pascal with pink-haired T.A.

# New School 

Today, I've been working in the industry for 20 years; my first 5 as a designer and last 15 years as a developer. Have I forgotten how to design?! Not at all!
