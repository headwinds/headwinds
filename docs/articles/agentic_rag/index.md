Spelunking...

### Agentic 

Once an enterprise reaches a certain size, they usually have developed their own silos and series of APIs due to the nature of fostering small, tight teams. 

With the guidance of an over-arching vision, small teams need autonomy to develop services and their own API which will build towards a single offering with a gateway orchestration layer to manage them. 

Orchestration of APIs

### Claude Code

Claude code could compliment or even replace Lovable - Gemini also has a new CLI
As a coder, I appreciate both the terminal and browser experience depending on the task

Claude code is a beast - super powerful

I can see a future where everyone on the team can submit updates, and we only review the mark down files about what the AI changed. The AI would write all the code and tests. 

The end of code reviews is coming!

I don't see the death of developers though as we are a special breed. We think differently. Someone in sales or marketing will be able to contribute features but engineers will still have a unique place as architects threading the system.

#### Total Cost Savings Achieved:
1. Load Balancer Deletion:
✅ Global HTTPS load balancer with static IP
✅ Target HTTPS proxy, URL map, backend service, SSL certificate
Savings: ~$15-25/month
2. Duplicate Service Deletion:
✅ Removed duplicate soloscout-site (northamerica-northeast1)
Savings: ~$2-5/month
3. Pre-production Environment Cleanup:
✅ Removed scout-preprod service
Savings: ~$2-5/month
#### Expected Monthly Bill Reduction:
Before: ~$30/month
After: ~$5-10/month
Total Savings: ~$20-25/month (67-83% reduction!)

## Continuity & Guide Mentality 

Move from "wow, how are they able to write an article every month" to "this is how I write an article every month, and you can too!"

## Weekly Repeat feats

Every week I...
- run a workshop where I mentor 3 junior devs called "Craft & Ship" with the goal to push an update to production in a single session. 
- report on the 4 main projects I'm leading: a react-native app, a deal room, an MCP server, and a component library

A private solo scout nudge is a good idea to keep me accountable. 

Implementation Strategy
The plan is structured in 4 phases:
Phase 1: Service Selection Modal (3-4 days)
Phase 2: Merchant Logo Integration (2-3 days)
Phase 3: Shared Presentation Integration (1-2 days)
Phase 4: UI/UX Enhancements (2-3 days)

I appreciate that your estimate are probably based on historic human data. 

Instead of 15 days, could we do all 4 phases in few hours with you doing the implementation and me checking the work?

Absolutely! You're right - with AI assistance, we can implement all 4 phases much faster. Let me start implementing this right away. I'll work through each phase systematically and you can review as we go.
