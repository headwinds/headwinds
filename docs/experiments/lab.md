# Lab

I want to start a new series of AI-assisted experiments where I spend a couple hours prototyping to learn something new, inspire others, and develop a work flow that I could use in the future.

I might need to split experiments up to several parts since I want to time box the experiment to something I can accomplish in a couple hours and write a Medium post about it.
 
I may not be able test them all in this time frame, and that's an interesting metric too. Some experiments could have several parts. 

## My Credibility Dip 

# Vanity Search Analysis: Your Digital Footprint \& Credibility Gaps

## Executive Summary

The search reveals a **near-complete absence** of publicly visible thought leadership, technical authority, or mission-driven brand alignment—creating both a critical vulnerability and a massive opportunity. While your 20+ years of experience and recent roles at Validere and GoBolt demonstrate execution capability, there is **zero discoverable evidence** of the founder mindset, climate tech passion, or technical vision that AXL and similar venture studios require. This invisibility is actively working against you in the venture studio ecosystem where credibility is built through visible expertise, not just private execution.

**Key Finding**: You are currently indistinguishable from thousands of other senior Toronto developers. The absence of a public portfolio, climate tech commentary, or technical philosophy signals to venture builders like Daniel Wigdor that you are a *skilled executor* but not yet a *venture co-founder*.

***

## What the Search Revealed (And What It Didn't)

### **Your Current Digital Footprint: Minimal to Non-Existent**

| Search Category | What Was Found | What Was Missing | Implication |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Personal Brand** | Generic LinkedIn profiles of other Toronto developers; no distinctive content under your name | Personal website, blog, technical essays, conference talks, podcast appearances | You appear as a "resume" not a "thought leader" |
| **Technical Authority** | Standard job postings for React/Redux/NestJS roles; no original frameworks, libraries, or deep technical contributions | GitHub projects with >100 stars, technical blog posts, open-source contributions, architecture case studies | No proof you can *invent* vs. *implement* |
| **Climate Tech Credibility** | Climate tech companies hiring (Peak Power, Validere, Terawatt) but no commentary from you | Blog posts on climate + software, carbon accounting analysis, sustainable logistics tech critiques | Your passion is invisible to the ecosystem you want to join |
| **Venture Studio Appeal** | AXL's portfolio and Daniel Wigdor's interviews; zero intersection with your public voice | Founder-style writing on "building vs. scaling," "0-to-1 prototyping," "technical de-risking" | You look like an employee, not a co-founder |
| **Toronto Ecosystem Presence** | Generic developer meetups; no speaking slots, mentorship roles, or community leadership | Toronto tech event speaker bios, mentorship program listings, local startup advisor roles | You're not seen as a community multiplier |

### **Critical Gap Analysis**

**The "20-Year Experience Paradox"**: Your two decades of experience are **undiscoverable**. Search engines show junior developers with active blogs ranking higher than your silent expertise. In the venture studio world, **unshared experience = non-existent experience**.

**The "Climate Passion vs. Climate Proof" Gap**: You mentioned being "into climate change and cabin culture," but search results show **zero** articles, GitHub repos, or LinkedIn posts connecting your technical work to decarbonization, sustainable logistics, or green building tech. This makes your passion sound like a hobby, not a mission.

**The "Full-Stack Prototyping" Invisibility**: Your core strength—solo prototyping across frontend and backend—is not demonstrated through public case studies, architecture deep-dives, or "build in public" threads. Venture studios like AXL need to *see* this capability, not just hear you describe it.

***

## Strategic Credibility Building Plan: 2026 Roadmap

### **Phase 1: Establish Technical Authority (Q1 2026)**

#### **1. Launch a "Prototyping Philosophy" Blog**

**Goal**: Position yourself as a 0-to-1 technical architect, not just a senior developer.

**Content Pillars**:

- **"The De-Risking Stack"**: Monthly deep-dives on how you choose technologies for rapid prototyping (e.g., "Why I Use NestJS for MVPs," "React vs. Next.js for First Customers")
- **"Full-Stack Integration Patterns"**: Case studies from your Validere/GoBolt experience, anonymized but technical (e.g., "Building Real-Time Emissions Tracking: Frontend-Backend Sync at Scale")
- **"Solo Founder Engineering"**: Frameworks for moving from idea to working demo in 72 hours

**Tactical Execution**:

- Platform: Substack (free tier) + custom domain (yourname.dev)
- Posting cadence: 1 deep technical essay (1,500+ words) every 2 weeks
- SEO target: "Toronto full-stack prototyping," "climate tech MVP architecture"

**Expected Outcome**: When Daniel Wigdor searches your name in March, he finds 6+ essays demonstrating technical depth and founder thinking.

#### **2. Open-Source Your Prototyping Toolkit**

**Goal**: Create discoverable proof of your "solo build" capability.

**Project Ideas** (aligned with your interests):

- **"CabinCalc"**: Open-source tool for calculating carbon footprint of rural/city living ratios (connects your cabin culture interest to climate data)
- **"LogisticsLite"**: Minimal NestJS + React boilerplate for supply chain MVPs (leverages your GoBolt logistics domain knowledge)
- **"EmissionsVis"**: React component library for visualizing carbon accounting data (ties to Validere's energy background)

**Tactical Execution**:

- GitHub: Create 3 repos with comprehensive READMEs, demo GIFs, and architecture docs
- Promotion: Link in every blog post, Twitter/X thread, and LinkedIn update
- Community: Submit to Hacker News, Reddit r/webdev, and Toronto JS meetup

**Expected Outcome**: GitHub profile becomes your technical portfolio, showing code quality and architectural thinking.

***

### **Phase 2: Build Climate Tech Credibility (Q2 2026)**

#### **3. Publish a "Climate Tech for Full-Stack Developers" Series**

**Goal**: Bridge your technical expertise with your climate passion, making it venture-relevant.

**Essay Topics**:

- **"Why Every Full-Stack Developer Should Understand Carbon Accounting APIs"**: Technical analysis of standards like GHG Protocol, OCPI for EV charging, or emissions tracking
- **"Building the Software Stack for Net-Zero Logistics"**: Deep-dive on GoBolt's carbon-neutral delivery tech, generalized for other startups
- **"The Cabin Culture Tech Stack: Off-Grid Living Meets Climate Monitoring"**: IoT + React + NestJS architecture for remote environmental sensing

**Distribution Strategy**:

- Cross-post to **ClimateTechList blog** (they accept contributor posts)
- Pitch to **Toronto Climate Week** as a speaker/session leader
- Share in **Work on Climate** Slack community (high-density climate tech talent)

**Expected Outcome**: You become known as "the Toronto developer who bridges climate and code"—exactly what AXL's portfolio companies need.

#### **4. Speak at 3 Toronto Tech/Climate Events**

**Goal**: Move from online to in-person credibility, essential for venture studio networks.

**Target Events**:

- **Toronto JS Meetup**: Present "Prototyping Full-Stack Climate Apps in 2026"
- **ClimateTechTO**: Lightning talk on "Software Architecture for Carbon Markets"
- **Creative Destruction Lab (CDL) Toronto**: Attend as "technical advisor" (free role, high prestige)

**Tactical Execution**:

- Submit CFPs (Call for Proposals) in January for Q2/Q3 events
- Record talks, post to YouTube, embed in blog
- Live-tweet events, tagging AXL portfolio companies and Daniel Wigdor

**Expected Outcome**: Your name appears in event photos, Twitter threads, and attendee recaps—building social proof.

***

### **Phase 3: Venture Studio Positioning (Q3-Q4 2026)**

#### **5. Launch "The Toronto Venture Builder" Newsletter**

**Goal**: Directly signal founder-studio fit to AXL and similar entities (CDL, ArcT Ventures).

**Content Strategy**:

- **Monthly deep-dive on a Toronto climate tech startup's tech stack** (e.g., "How Peak Power Built Their Forecast Platform")
- **Interviews with technical founders** (start with peers, work up to AXL portfolio CTOs)
- **"De-Risking Playbook"**: Your framework for technical validation before Series A

**Subscriber Target**: 500+ by December 2026 (Toronto tech founders, VCs, venture studio partners)

**Expected Outcome**: Daniel Wigdor subscribes; you have direct channel to demonstrate ongoing value.

#### **6. Create a Public "Venture Portfolio"**

**Goal**: Show you can think like a founder by publicly analyzing venture ideas.

**Format**: "12 Climate Tech MVPs I'd Build in 2026"—a living document on your blog.

**Example Ideas**:

- **"Carbon-Aware Logistics Dashboard"**: For GoBolt-style companies to optimize routes by marginal emissions
- **"Off-Grid Energy Monitor"**: For cabin culture enthusiasts to track solar/storage performance
- **"Emissions Data API Wrapper"**: Simplifying Validere-style integrations for smaller operators

**For each idea**: Include 1-page technical architecture, stack choices, and why now. Update monthly with progress on any you prototype.

**Expected Outcome**: When AXL has a new venture, your name is top-of-mind as the technical co-founder who "already thought through this."

***

## Specific Credibility Metrics to Track

### **By March 31, 2026**

- **2 technical essays published** (Substack, avg. 1,000+ words)
- **1 open-source repo launched** (GitHub, >50 stars target)
- **1 Toronto tech event attended** (with public tweet thread)


### **By June 30, 2026**

- **6 technical essays published** (consistent bi-weekly cadence)
- **3 open-source repos** (thematic suite around prototyping/climate)
- **1 speaking slot secured** (Toronto JS or similar)
- **LinkedIn following: 500+** (target: Toronto founders, climate tech VCs)


### **By December 31, 2026**

- **12+ technical essays** (established voice)
- **1,000+ newsletter subscribers** (venture studio ecosystem)
- **3 speaking engagements delivered** (with YouTube recordings)
- **GitHub profile: 200+ stars across repos** (demonstrates community value)
- **Direct inbound**: At least 1 venture studio or climate tech founder reaches out to you (not you applying)

***

## What Not to Do (Common Traps)

**❌ Don't**: Build a generic portfolio site listing "React, Redux, NestJS" skills. This is indistinguishable from junior developers.

**❌ Don't**: Write about "learning climate tech" or "transitioning to climate." Frame it as "applying 20 years of full-stack expertise to climate's hardest software problems."

**❌ Don't**: Post on LinkedIn about "looking for opportunities." Instead, post about what you're *building*—the opportunities will come.

**❌ Don't**: Wait for "perfect" ideas. Your first blog post will be mediocre. Ship it. Venture studios value velocity over polish.

***

## The AXL-Specific Angle

Given Daniel Wigdor's emphasis on **human-centric AI** and **Canadian IP retention**, tailor your content:

- **Human-Centric**: Frame your prototyping philosophy around "augmenting human decision-making" (e.g., "How I Build Tools That Make Operators Smarter, Not Replace Them")
- **Canadian IP**: Write about "Why I'm Building Open-Source Climate Tools in Toronto, Not Silicon Valley"
- **Venture Studio Model**: Analyze AXL's portfolio publicly: "How CodeAid's Architecture Reflects AXL's De-Risking Strategy"

**Final Tactic**: In Q4 2026, email Daniel Wigdor directly with a link to your newsletter and a specific insight about one of AXL's ventures—no ask, just value. This transforms you from "interviewee" to "peer."

***

## Bottom Line

Your credibility gap is not a skills deficit—it's a **visibility deficit**. In 2026, you must **stop being a private expert and start being a public authority**. The venture studio ecosystem doesn't reward silent competence; it rewards demonstrable, mission-aligned expertise. Your first interview with Daniel Wigdor got you in the door. Your public credibility will keep you in the room as a co-founder, not just a candidate.
