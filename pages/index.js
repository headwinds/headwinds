Electric [flash the electric emoji]
Hi, I'm Brandon Flowers, and I'm a Full Stack Sofware engineer.

I prefer React, Node, Springboot Java, Go and SQL.

React means React Native - I have a secret project with Expo, NestJS and PostgreSQL.

FULL STACK

I built the API powering this website with NextJS, Python (Flask) and PostgreSQL.

FULL STACK 

I delight in building end to end solutions that efficient and performant.

The frontend should be aesthetically-pleasing; load quickly; and responsive.

The backend should be scalable, secure and reliable.

I want to collaborate with mission-driven big thinkers and machine learning engineers.

Both sides should be well-tested and instrumented.

I'm passionate about AI Assistants, E-Commerce, Architecture and our Electric future.
