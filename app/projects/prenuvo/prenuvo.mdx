I joined Prenuvo as a fullstack engineer at the end of March. My first project was to develop their design system which lasted the first 3 months. This was my third professional designed system and first that wasn't developeed from scratch. We followed the current trend set forth by Shadcn to adopt Radix UI as our design system and skin the components. By adoptiong Radix, we were able to focus on the design and development of the components and not the design system itself.

This allowed us to quickly develop the design system and move on to the next project. Compared to previous design systems, this was the fastest and most efficient design system I have developed taking half the time of the previous design systems.

In June, I began contributing the Viewer project where Radiologists can view the MRI scans. It is built with the [OHIF Viewer](https://ohif.org/) and we are customizing it to fit our needs.

After that, I was assigned to the DICOM Parser project.
