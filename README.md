## Work

I'm currently 3 years into life at [Lobaw Digital](https://loblawdigital.co/) learning all things eCommerce. 

In January of 2022, I transitioned from a Frontend specialist to a Full-stack generalist and DevOps manager. My Gitlab graph definitely reflects that change.

Loblaw Digital does not use Github although I'm a big fan of it especially co-polit.

Depending on the task, I've been writing small Java, Go, and Python programs aka micro-services that monitor our feed servers and SQL database through evented systems. I also spend more time herding cats than code. 

## Work/Play 

Over the last 2 years, I've been collaborating off and on with David & Nick to create a new media sharing app (Expo/React Native) and hobby social network (NestJS & PostgreSQL).

Launch: maybe the fall of 2022?!
