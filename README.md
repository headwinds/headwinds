# Analytics, Data Visualizaiton, and a sense of Adventure

## Currently (2023)

I'm 2 months into life @ [Validere](https://validere.com/) producing Data Visualizaions to monitor carbon and methane gas.

The world needs to work together to reduce emissions towards [net zero](https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/what-is-net-zero-emissions-climate-change) and levels pre-industrial revolution!

I'm also personally exploring what [net-zero](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/weather/climatechange/climate-plan/net-zero-emissions-2050.html) means to Canada and my neighborhood/ I'll use [cross-country](https://github.com/headwinds/cross-country) to present some experiments and charts dealing with this climate crisis at large, and how we can measure it's impact locally.

## Previously (2019 - 2023)

I enjoyed nearly 4 years @ [Lobaw Digital](https://loblawdigital.co/) learning all things eCommerce.

Loblaw Digital does not use Github although I'm a big fan of it especially co-polit.

Depending on the task, I've been writing small Java, Go, and Python programs aka micro-services that monitor our feed servers and SQL database through evented systems. I also spend more time herding cats than code. I face many issues like we're missing 3 days worth of orders, what happened to that 250k? Or our recommnedation engine has stopped receiving it's feed, what gives?!

## Full Stack

Over the last 2 years, I've been collaborating off and on with David & Nick to create a new media sharing app (Expo/React Native) and hobby social network ([NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) & PostgreSQL).

[Secret project](https://github.com/Project-PD)

Launch: maybe the Spring of 2023?! In the meantime, you can enjoy some of my React Native Expo snacks:
