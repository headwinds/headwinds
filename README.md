# Analytics, Data Visualizaiton, and a sense of Adventure

### Currently (2023)

I'm 2 months into life @ [Validere](https://validere.com/) producing Data Visualizaions to monitor carbon and methane gas.

The world needs to work together to reduce emissions towards [net zero](https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/what-is-net-zero-emissions-climate-change) and levels pre-industrial revolution!

I'm also personally exploring what [net-zero means to Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/weather/climatechange/climate-plan/net-zero-emissions-2050.html) and my neighborhood. I'll use [cross-country](https://github.com/headwinds/cross-country) to present some experiments and charts dealing with this climate crisis at large, and how we can measure it's impact locally.

Although I did warm to Gitlab, I'm happy to be back on Github (we use Github, AWS & Vercel!), and hopefully we can convince the powers that be to also adopt Enterprise [Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot). Along with code suggestions, I find Copilot is a major productivity boost simply for its ability to autocomplete repetitive tasks.

I'm currently part of a task force collecting any evidence that its now safe to use professionally; that is won't steal or leak any of our IP. Early accounts that it wasn't secure certainly hurt its reputation, and I'm trying to put a case together to overcome that and convince our legal team that we have nothing to worry about today. Stay tuned! I feel this research should be open sourced, and I'll share what I can.

### Previously (2019 - 2023)

I enjoyed nearly 4 years @ [Lobaw Digital](https://loblawdigital.co/) learning all things eCommerce.

Loblaw Digital does not use Github although I'm a big fan of it especially co-polit.

Depending on the task, I've been writing small Java, Go, and Python programs aka micro-services that monitor our feed servers and SQL database through evented systems. I also spend more time herding cats than code. I face many issues like we're missing 3 days worth of orders, what happened to that 250k? Or our recommnedation engine has stopped receiving it's feed, what gives?!

### Secret Full Stack Project

Over the last 2 years, I've been collaborating off and on with David & Nick to create a new media sharing app (Expo/React Native) and hobby social network ([NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) & PostgreSQL).

[Secret project](https://github.com/Project-PD)

Launch: maybe the Spring of 2023?! In the meantime, you can enjoy some of my React Native Expo snacks:

This repo serves my site [headwinds.vercel.app](https://headwinds.vercel.app/) which is a [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) app leveraging my component library [cross-country](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cross-country) and distributed backend involving Python, Pusher, Postgres, & RabbitMQ.

It can be installed:

```
npm i
npm run dev
```
