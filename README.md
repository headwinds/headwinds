# Analytics, Data Visualizaiton, and a sense of Adventure

### Present

I am seeking new exmployment. Ideally, I'm looking to join a company as either a Senior or Staff level engineer where I can lead and build frontend React UI as well contribute to the SQL-based backend with either Node, Python or Go. I would also be happy to write 100% frontend code and collaborate with backend engineers and data scientists. I can always explore new languages in my spare time and I enjoy learning how they all fit together securely by buiding a project from front to back.

### (Feb 6/2023 - Dec 1/2023)

I'm enjoying frontend dev life @ [Validere](https://validere.com/) producing UI dashboards & Data Visualizaions.

We measure carbon and methane gas across various industries with a current focus on [Oil & Gas](https://www.validere.com/carbon-hub) as well as Agriculture where we are exploring the best methods to collect and report on [carbon sequestration](https://info.biologicalcarbon.ca/carbon-storage-publications?gclid=CjwKCAjwpuajBhBpEiwA_Ztfhf-Q7zSz2MSdZiPA4BRXdUasZ2LOMIJ4D8bWaCUBvV0S4hvpdRKOCxoCIuIQAvD_BwE).

The world needs to work together to reduce emissions towards [net zero](https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/what-is-net-zero-emissions-climate-change) which doesn't mean no emissions but to the levels that existed before the industrial revolution!

I'm also personally exploring what [net-zero means to Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/weather/climatechange/climate-plan/net-zero-emissions-2050.html) and my neighborhood. I'll use [cross-country](https://github.com/headwinds/cross-country) to present some experiments and charts dealing with this climate crisis at large, and how we can measure it's impact locally.

Although I did warm to Gitlab, I'm happy to be back on Github (we use Github, AWS & Vercel!), and hopefully we can convince the powers that be to also adopt Enterprise [Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot). Along with code suggestions, I find Copilot is a major productivity boost simply for its ability to autocomplete repetitive tasks.

I'm currently part of a task force collecting any evidence that its now safe to use professionally; that is won't steal or leak any of our IP. Early accounts that it wasn't secure certainly hurt its reputation, and I'm trying to put a case together to overcome that and convince our legal team that we have nothing to worry about today. Stay tuned! I feel this research should be open sourced, and I'll share what I can.

### Previously (Sept 4/2019 - Feb 2/2023)

I enjoyed nearly 4 years @ [Lobaw Digital](https://loblawdigital.co/) learning all things eCommerce.

Loblaw Digital uses Gitlab which likes cool blue over forest greens to present developer productivity.

Depending on the task, I've been writing small Java, Go, and Python programs aka micro-services that monitor our feed servers and SQL database through evented systems. I also spend more time herding cats than code. I face many issues like we're missing 3 days worth of orders, what happened to that 250k? Or our recommnedation engine has stopped receiving it's feed, what gives?!

### Secret Full Stack Project

Over the last 2 years, I've been collaborating with [David](https://github.com/djensenius) & [Nick](https://github.com/nickpagee) to create a photo sharing app (Expo/React Native) and hobby social network ([NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) & PostgreSQL.

Launch: maybe the Spring of 2023?! In the meantime, you can enjoy some of my React Native Expo snacks:

This repo serves my site [headwinds.vercel.app](https://headwinds.vercel.app/) which is a [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) app leveraging my component library [cross-country](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cross-country) and distributed backend involving Python, Pusher, Postgres, & RabbitMQ.

It can be installed:

```
npm i
npm run dev
```
