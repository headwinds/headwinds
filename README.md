# React UI, Analytics, APIs and a sense of Adventure

### Present

I am seeking new exmployment. Ideally, I'm looking to join a company as either a Senior or Staff level engineer where I can lead and build frontend React UI as well contribute to the SQL-based backend with either Node, Python or Go. I would also be happy to write 100% frontend code and collaborate with backend engineers and data scientists. I can always explore new languages in my spare time and I enjoy learning how they all fit together securely by buiding a project from front to back.

### (Feb 6/2023 - Dec 1/2023)

While at [Validere](https://validere.com/) I lead the frontend development effort for their new Carbon Hub Home page producing the UI that orchestrates many components including Filter Panels, Cluster Maps, Charts, Metric Tiles and Data Tables that will all react to each other and update. Along with another developer, I also helped pioneer their first React-Native [mobile app](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/validere/id6446293374) which we released in the 3 phrases beginning it version 3.0 over 6 months. 

We measure carbon and methane gas across various industries with a current focus on [Oil & Gas](https://www.validere.com/carbon-hub) as well as Agriculture where we are exploring the best methods to collect and report on [carbon sequestration](https://info.biologicalcarbon.ca/carbon-storage-publications?gclid=CjwKCAjwpuajBhBpEiwA_Ztfhf-Q7zSz2MSdZiPA4BRXdUasZ2LOMIJ4D8bWaCUBvV0S4hvpdRKOCxoCIuIQAvD_BwE).

The world needs to work together to reduce emissions towards [net zero](https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/what-is-net-zero-emissions-climate-change) which doesn't mean no emissions but to the levels that existed before the industrial revolution!

I'm also personally exploring what [net-zero means to Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/weather/climatechange/climate-plan/net-zero-emissions-2050.html) and my neighborhood. I'll use [cross-country](https://github.com/headwinds/cross-country) to present some experiments and charts dealing with this climate crisis at large, and how we can measure it's impact locally.

Although I did warm to Gitlab, I'm happy to be back on Github (we use Github, AWS & Vercel!), and hopefully we can convince the powers that be to also adopt Enterprise [Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot). Along with code suggestions, I find Copilot is a major productivity boost simply for its ability to autocomplete repetitive tasks.

I'm currently part of a task force collecting any evidence that its now safe to use professionally; that is won't steal or leak any of our IP. Early accounts that it wasn't secure certainly hurt its reputation, and I'm trying to put a case together to overcome that and convince our legal team that we have nothing to worry about today. Stay tuned! I feel this research should be open sourced, and I'll share what I can.

### Previously (Sept 4/2019 - Feb 2/2023)

I enjoyed nearly 4 years @ [Lobaw Digital](https://loblawdigital.co/) learning all things eCommerce.

Loblaw Digital uses Gitlab which likes cool blue over forest greens to present developer productivity.

I mostly built React-based UI with some vanilla JS on legacy systems. We invested heavily in GraphQL to write efficient endpoints and provide a caching layer. Along with the home page and checkout experience, my favourite page was the product detail page for Shopper's Drug Mart which is responsive, accessible, and driven by GraphQL. 

Along with UI, I also had the opportunity to write tools and backend services in Java, Go, and Python that monitor our feed servers and SQL database through evented systems. While on page duty, I faced many issues like we're missing 3 days worth of orders, what happened to that 250k? Or our recommnedation engine has stopped receiving it's feed, why has it stopped? So I first experiment with Bashed and finally landed on Go as the best language to monitor and report on our feed servers.

### Secret Full Stack Project

Over the last 2 years, I've been collaborating with [David](https://github.com/djensenius) & [Nick](https://github.com/nickpagee) to create a photo sharing app (Expo/React Native) and hobby social network ([NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) & PostgreSQL) which is deployed to Azure.

Launch: maybe the Spring of 2023?! In the meantime, you can enjoy some of my React Native Expo snacks:

This repo serves my site [headwinds.vercel.app](https://headwinds.vercel.app/) which is a [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) app leveraging my component library [cross-country](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cross-country) and distributed backend involving Python, Pusher, Postgres, & RabbitMQ.

It can be installed:

```
npm i
npm run dev
```
