# UI, Analytics, APIs and a sense of Adventure

### Profile

With 10+ years experience, I've built hundreds of apps generating billions in revenue. I'm a confident a [senior developer](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/brandonflowers) always aspiring to be [Staff engineer](https://twitter.com/headwinds/status/1773501547520864685) where I can lead the team and collaborate with business, design, backend engineers and data scientists. I like to primarily craft the frontend with React but can also take on some backend tasks in Node, Pyton or Go.

### Work

#### GoBolt (2025)

![last_mile](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf030738-47ba-40f9-9408-60275a0a9bb3)

GoBolt's misison for [sustainable logistics](https://www.gobolt.com/sustainable-logistics) aligns perfectly with my desire to confront our climate crisis and provide services that actually affect change. Along with monitoring carbon offsets, I'm fascinated with all the design challenges of creating distributed apps that simplify the shipping experience, networking and tracking the various phases as products move from the merchant to our front doors. I want to combine my passion for data visualization, mapping, and user experience to optimize the delivery flow, providing valuable metrics and customer journey insights at every step.     

#### Prenuvo (2024)

I joined [Prenuvo](https://www.prenuvo.com/prenuvo-app) to help make full body MRI scans accessible to all! One day it could and should be as affordable as a dental cleaning. As an interface developer, I get this great opportunity to do data visualization and collaborate with their AI team to assist radiologists in reviewing scans. [Vladek's story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0unTW6WPDjk) expresses the benefits of early detection.

#### Validere (2023)

While at [Validere](https://validere.com/) I lead the frontend development effort for their new Carbon Hub Home page producing the UI that orchestrates many components including Filter Panels, Cluster Maps, Charts, Metric Tiles and Data Tables that will all react to each other and update. Along with another developer, I also helped pioneer their first React-Native [mobile app](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/validere/id6446293374) which we released in the 3 phrases beginning it version 3.0 over 6 months.

Validere measures carbon and methane gas across various industries with a current focus on [Oil & Gas](https://www.validere.com/carbon-hub) as well as Agriculture where we are exploring the best methods to collect and report on [carbon sequestration](https://info.biologicalcarbon.ca/carbon-storage-publications?gclid=CjwKCAjwpuajBhBpEiwA_Ztfhf-Q7zSz2MSdZiPA4BRXdUasZ2LOMIJ4D8bWaCUBvV0S4hvpdRKOCxoCIuIQAvD_BwE).

#### Loblaws Digital (2019 - 2023)

I enjoyed 4 years @ [Lobaw Digital](https://loblawdigital.co/) learning all things eCommerce. I mostly built React-based UI with some vanilla JS on legacy systems. We invested heavily in GraphQL to write efficient endpoints and provide a caching layer. Along with the home page and checkout experience, my favourite page was the product detail page for Shopper's Drug Mart which is responsive, accessible, and driven by GraphQL.

Along with UI, I also had the opportunity to write tools and backend services in Java, Go, and Python that monitor our feed servers and SQL database through event systems. While on page duty, I faced many issues like we're missing 3 days worth of orders, what happened to that 250k? Or our recommendation engine has stopped receiving it's feed, why has it stopped? So I first experiment with Bashed and finally landed on Go as the best language to monitor and report on our feed servers.

Loblaw Digital uses Gitlab which likes cool blue over forest greens to present developer productivity.

### Not so Secret Full Stack Project

Introducing [PhotoDare](https://www.photodare.ca/) which is now live in the [app store for iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/photodare/id6479333804)

I've been collaborating with [David](https://github.com/djensenius) & [Nick](https://github.com/nickpagee) to create a photo sharing app (Expo/React Native) and social network ([NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) & PostgreSQL) which is deployed to Azure.

### Future

As a side-hustle, I've started a project to guide users to map their own development course - a Linear for your life - while chatting with AI and mining their existing productivity apps like Gmail and Google calendar. It's in the early prototyping phases and not ready to share yet, I'm mainly building with React, Python (flask), [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/), [Perplexity Labs](https://labs.perplexity.ai/), and PostgreSQL.
